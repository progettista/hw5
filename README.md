In the class this week we went through a typical design cycle of a task-oriented conversational interface:

1. Corpus. Build corpus of examples that are in-domain (related to the task) and out-of-doman (not related to the task).
2. Design. Design the interface (the chatbot) that covers (properly responds to) some in-domain utterances
3. Run. Run the whole corpus through the chatbot and label each example as correctly or incorrectly handled by the chatbot.
4. Compute TP (true positive), FP (false positive), FN (false negative), TN (true negative) rates, and Recall and Precision values.
5. Analyze errors (false positive and false negative cases) and redesign your chatbot to minimize them (go to Step 2).

In this homework you will go through this process at least 3 times, trying to improve your task-oriented chatbot.
